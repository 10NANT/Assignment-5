# Assignment 5 – Sorting

## Problem
For this assignment, I chose a scenario where student IDs need to be sorted so they can be viewed and processed more easily.

## Solution
I created a simple program that sorts a list of student ID numbers using sorting algorithms.

Sorting the IDs makes it easier to:
- read the data
- search through the list
- see which IDs come first or last

## How It Works
The program starts with an unsorted list of student IDs.
It then applies different sorting algorithms to arrange the IDs in ascending order.

Each sorting method rearranges the values step by step until the entire list is ordered.
The sorted results are printed so the effect of sorting is clear.
